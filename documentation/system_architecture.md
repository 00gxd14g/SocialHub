# SocialHub System Architecture

This document outlines the system architecture for the SocialHub application, a comprehensive social media management platform.




## 1. Introduction

SocialHub is a web-based application designed to provide a centralized platform for managing multiple social media accounts. It allows users to create, schedule, and publish content, as well as monitor analytics and engage with their audience. The system is designed to be scalable, secure, and user-friendly, with a modern and responsive user interface.

## 2. Architecture Overview

The system follows a classic three-tier architecture:

*   **Frontend:** A single-page application (SPA) built with React, providing a rich and interactive user experience.
*   **Backend:** A RESTful API built with Flask, responsible for business logic, data processing, and communication with social media platforms.
*   **Database:** A relational database (PostgreSQL) for storing user data, social media accounts, posts, and analytics.

## 3. Component Breakdown

### 3.1. Frontend (React)

The frontend is responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions. It communicates with the backend API to fetch and display data. Key features of the frontend include:

*   **Dashboard:** Displays an overview of social media analytics and scheduled posts.
*   **Authentication:** Handles user login, registration, and session management.
*   **Post Creation:** A rich text editor for creating and scheduling posts.
*   **Analytics:** Visualizations and reports for social media performance.
*   **Account Management:** Allows users to connect and manage their social media accounts.

### 3.2. Backend (Flask)

The backend is the core of the system, handling all business logic and data processing. Key responsibilities of the backend include:

*   **User Management:** Handles user authentication and authorization.
*   **Social Media Integration:** Connects to social media APIs (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn) to publish posts and retrieve data.
*   **Content Management:** Stores and manages user-generated content.
*   **Scheduling:** A background worker for publishing scheduled posts.
*   **Analytics Processing:** Collects and processes analytics data from social media platforms.

### 3.3. Database (PostgreSQL)

The database stores all persistent data for the application. The schema is designed to be normalized and efficient, with the following key tables:

*   **users:** Stores user information, including credentials and profile data.
*   **social_accounts:** Stores information about connected social media accounts, including access tokens.
*   **posts:** Stores information about created posts, including content and scheduling.
*   **post_platforms:** A join table to associate posts with the platforms they are published on.
*   **analytics:** Stores analytics data for each social media account.
